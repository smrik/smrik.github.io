## The EU will emerge stronger

Because of Trump's volatile statements, the EU will have to decide to protect themselves by pushing for defence spending and more federalisation.
Positive signals right now:
- United front against Trump
- Good relations with UK (UK stepping in to help Ukraine)
- Mertz plan for German defence spending (big investment, looser deficit rules)
- Le Pen banned from elections
- Slowing of right-wing, anti-EU parties
