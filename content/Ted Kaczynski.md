[Ted Kaczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski): Theodore John Kaczynski ( May 22, 1942 – June 10, 2023),
also known as the Unabomber ( YOO-nə-bom-ər), was an American mathematician and domestic terrorist. A mathematics prodigy, he abandoned his academic career in 1969 to pursue a reclusive primitive lifestyle and lone wolf terrorism campaign.

Kaczynski murdered 3 people and injured 23 others between 1978 and 1995 in a nationwide mail bombing campaign against people he believed to be advancing modern technology and the destruction of the natural environment. 

He authored a roughly 35,000-word manifesto and social critique called Industrial Society and Its Future (1995) which opposes all forms of technology, rejects leftism and fascism, advocates cultural primitivism, and ultimately suggests violent revolution.

Hanged himself in prison in 2023.
