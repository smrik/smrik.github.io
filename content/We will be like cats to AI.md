## We will be like cats to AI

Granted it sounds stupid and out there, but with some people claiming that AI will want to get rid of us when it becomes vastly smarter then us - I just have to disagree. 

We have a cat that effectively does nothing around the house, just lays there, eats food and even hisses at use sometimes. It costs money to feed and time to clean after her. So why do we have it? Well because it makes us feel nice, we are giving a home to a nice animal and we pet it and laugh. In her mind, she does things - she guards the house, patrols around on set times in mornings and evenings, marks her territory etc. But to us that seems just like a cute meaningless thing cats do.

We are vastly more intelligent than the cat, but do we want to get rid of her? No.

So if AI becomes vastly smarter than us, why would it want to get rid of us? Well here I have two views:
1. It will get rid of us: the reason we keep animals is because they make us feel joy, which is largely a human emotion and AI won't (well i don't know - [[Can AI have emotions?]]) have the emotions, so it will get no benefit from taking care of us.
2. It won't get rid of us: the other scenario is that we will become in turn like AI's pets. They will do the actual work and provide for us, give us money etc. Maybe they will even let us go to work (like a sham job that feels meaningful to us - like a cat pissing to mark territory - huge for her, bullshit for us) and feel like it means something. But it won't. 
	- is that bad: well no, when I look at my cat I'm jealous that she gets to not have any worry in life and just lives in bliss
