## IV crush / crunch

IV gradually rises leading up to earnings (with traders anticipating big moves) and then drops significantly after the stock moves in either direction. Presents an opportunity if implied move is greater then historically implied move for short volatility and inverse with at the money straddles. Should start following a week or two before earnings.
