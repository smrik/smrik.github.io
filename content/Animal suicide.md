## Animal suicide

- [Wiki - Animal suicide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_suicide)

Kind of obvious, when an animal intentionally ends its own life through its actions.

- is debated among scientists, because it would imply animals to have the following:
	- [[Concept of self]]
	- Concept of death
	- Future intention

Example: Do bees just instinctively protect their beehive or do they know of the sacrifice?

- is it just humans anthropomorphizing animals or is there actually something there?
