## About
Why this blog: I don't really know. I think that just putting some of my ideas and thoughts out there (not that they are actually anything special - I'm not that arrogant) will help me organize my knowledge and will also keep my accountable to keep this growing. Hopefully it will also add some meaning to my random adventures of going down the rabbit hole on just about any topic. So I guess if I write a blog post about it, I will feel at least some sense of accomplishment and it won't feel like a complete waste. And writing has never been a strong suit of mine, so this will hopefully make me a better writer (well or at least make my writing passable).

## Topics I intend to cover

##### AI & Singularity
- Obviously a topics **no one ever** mentions in the current day and age ðŸ˜Š I'm joking obviously. But I do Genuinely believe it will change things, hence my interest.
- So I intend to talk about:
	- The history of AI
	- Tips & tricks for getting more out of AI (MCP, Skills, Fine-tuning)
	- Upcoming developments
	- My predictions for the future (I tend to change my mind about these just about every day)
##### Finance & Economics
- Well it is what I study, and for a good reason:I just think that economics in general is behind every decision made ever. I believe that improving efficiency overall makes the world a better place. (I have to follow this up with a blog post later - this is a bit vague)
- Topics:
	- Conceptual ideas about economics
	- Financial markets and their quirks
	- Equity research / Corporate valuation
	- Quantitative analysis
	- Behavioural economics
##### Politics
- I think economics & politics go hand in hand. It's hard to make a change, if other stakeholders (i.e. the voters) are not convinced. And as mentioned above - every decision in politics is a cost-benefit analysis. There will be trade-offs, but we should strive for the greater good
##### Psychology
- The human mind is interesting. Sometimes quite annoying and playing tricks on us, leading to all sorts of irrational actions. I like to learn about it, mainly to understand what is going on in my head, but also to understand the behaviour of others. 
- Here I intend to talk about:
	- Cognitive distortions
	- Personality
	- Contemporary issues - effect of technology on us
	- Mental health
##### Other
- This will probably be broken down after I begin to develop my style and interests, so this is just very broad for now and I will list some things that I had in mind and seem kind of fun to me:
	- **Movie & Album reviews** - I like movies, I like music - kind of self-explanatory why this is here
	- **Sports** - Probably mostly Formula 1, some NBA mixed in for good measure
	- **Research digest** - Summaries of some cool things I will have read - mostly research articles, there is always something. Will also serve as as reference to myself later when I inevitably forget what I've rad
	- **Data visualisation** - I like data and charts (my favourite program on my laptop is Excel - I actually have a freak in the sheets mug to prove it ðŸ˜Š). If I find some interesting data, I will try to make it into a nice visual and show it here - just for fun
	- **Self-improvement & Learning** - I like to learn and try to make it more fun and more effective (I will explore that here no doubt - some techniques, tips & tricks, etc)
	- **Ranting** - I will eventually be upset at something and will put it here. Just as an outlet maybe? We will see - it's early days (literally the first day)
	- **Jokes?** - Based on my interests it's clear that I have a good sense of humor (jk). If I find something funny I might share.
