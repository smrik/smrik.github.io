## Surprisingly popular

A wisdom of the crowd technique that uses the expert minority opinion of the crowd by asking:
- What is the probability that this answer is correct (your percieved knowledge)
- What is the probability that others will give to this answer (your percieved knowledge of others - how more qualified you are)

The non-expert group will give similar estimates, therefore cancelling themselves out.
