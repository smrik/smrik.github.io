# Is the stock market bubble real?

Recently, there has been a lot of talk about the so-called AI bubble on the US stock market. This is usually related to some companies with truly outrageous valuation multiples - namely Nvidia and Palantir, but also Meta and Alphabet. 

While I understand the valuations look scary, I do believe in AI and that most people underestimate what exponential growth truly look like. The doubling rate of compute (???) was 7 months for the last 3-5 years. That is truly remarkable if we want to put it in perspective. This makes me remember an episode of Friends. In that episode Chandler is bragging about getting a new work laptop, which was at the time top of the line. (VIDEO BELOW)

> [!cite] 
> **Chandler :** All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of RAM. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s.
> **Phoebe :** Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
> **Chandler :** [doggedly] Games and stuff.

>    *Friends, Season 2 Episode 8* -  [Source](https://www.fanfr.com/scripts/saison2/friendsgeneration2.php?nav=script&version=vo&episodescript=208)

So this episode aired in November 16, 1995 [^1] as per IMDB. Almost exactly 30 years ago. My smartphone - and most flagships- currently has 12 GB of RAM. My phone - not my laptop (which has 32 GB). That is 1000 times as much in 30 years. If this development trend stays the same, in another 30 years (2055), the common persons smartphone (well it probably won't actually used in the same way, but for the sake of the argument, let's just imagine) would have 12 TB of RAM. That is outrageous, more than the storage of some modern servers. 

and it had 500 MB hard drive - mine is 500 GB - in 30 years, it will be 500 TB

12 MB of RAM 

## 🧠 Question
What am I trying to test, explain, or visualize?

> Example: After a ≥ −3% down day in SPY, what typically happens over the next 5 trading days?

Would you like me to make a **second version** tailored for *non-data reflective posts* (e.g., essays or insight notes)? It would pair nicely with this analytical one.
