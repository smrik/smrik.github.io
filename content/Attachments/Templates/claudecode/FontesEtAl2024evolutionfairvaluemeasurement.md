      While double-entry accounting was in use in the fourteenth century, it does not appear in writing until 1494, when Fra. Luca Pacioli writes ‘Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et Proportionalita’ that dealt with ledgers and provided the first description of the accounting cycle to be used by Venetian merchants. The book is a summary of state-of-the-art mathematical knowledge

      The first modern mutual fund was launched in the US in 1924, and after the stock market crash in 1929 regulators recognised the need to safeguard mutual fund investors. This led to the requirement that mutual funds register with the SEC and disclose their holdings and performance

      the IASB states that ‘The objective of general purpose financial reporting is to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions relating to providing resources to the entity’  
      
      
      

    
**Page 761** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=761&annotation=TY335BC8)
      IASB conceptual framework describes two categories of measurement bases: historical cost and current value (IASB 2018). Current value includes fair value, value in use (fulfilment value for liabilities), and current cost

      Board understood any decisions were likely to be highly controversial  
      
      
      

    
**Page 761** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=761&annotation=99WUKXJQ)
      ‘accountants have strongly-held, and ultimately-polarizing, views of which is the most relevant and reliable attribute to be measured’  
      
      
      

    
**Page 761** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=761&annotation=6Y5INQNF)
      While there is significant discussion about how to initially measure an item in the financial statements, e.g. should loans for a bank be measured at fair value at initial measurement, it is remeasurement that causes the greatest debates, e.g. whether loans for a bank should be maintained at fair value  
      
      
      

    
**Page 761** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=761&annotation=T9IGT78U)
      When an asset or a liability initially measured at exit price is remeasured at exit price at the end of a reporting period, the change in value needs to be recorded in the financial statements. There are three choices: as a component of net income, a component of comprehensive income or directly into equity  
      
      
      

    
**Page 761** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=761&annotation=MILDXVSM)
      Remeasurement is really at the heart of the argument

      centre of some of the most polarising views: fair value measurement  
      
      
      

    
**Page 761** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=761&annotation=Y2GMT26A)
      Currently, fair value is defined by both FASB and IASB as ‘the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date’  
      
      
      

    
**Page 762** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=762&annotation=W6AUK7IS)
      It was not until the reign of Louis XIV in France that we see the first accounting regulation with the publication of the Ordinance in 1673 for private firms  
      
      
      

    
**Page 762** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=762&annotation=BQAMCI4E)
      In the UK, concerns about measurement uncertainty led, in part, to the Joint Stock Company legislation in the late 1800s (Maltby 1998). Also, the creation of corporate income taxes by the Revenue Acts of the early 1900s incentivised corporations to push for historical cost accounting  
      
      
      

    
**Page 763** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=763&annotation=RVE6BGWK)
      Their differences in views over the purpose of income and method of its measurement represents, in some respect, the start of the long and sometimes heated academic debate about measurement in financial statements  
      
      
      

    
**Page 763** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=763&annotation=FJ8EEN3G)
      In the US, the rules are heavily influenced by the experiences of one of the founding Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioners, Robert Healy  
      
      
      

    
**Page 763** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=763&annotation=FHN89FZH)
      For example, what is the value of a share that is actively traded in a deep and liquid exchange? Should the value be the bid price, the ask price, the high or low traded price for the day  
      
      
      

    
**Page 763** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=763&annotation=3QQHAD6I)
      For instance, if there is a demand for information about managers’ actions (stewardship demand), the information provided must be hard, leaving as little room as possible for dispute  
      
      
      

    
**Page 764** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=764&annotation=568NA84N)
      notion of value that we have loosely grouped into three basic types: exit price, entry price and value in use. An exit price is the price that an investor would receive for the sale of the asset or would pay to transfer the liability, i.e. it is the price to exit the market. An entry price is the price that an investor would pay to purchase an asset or would receive to assume a liability. In essence, the bid and ask price for a share are equivalent to an entry and exit price  
      
      
      

    
**Page 764** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=764&annotation=UBG23E6K)
      First, they propose that income should be separated into two components: holding gains/losses and operating gains/losses. Holding gains accrue over time and operating gains result from operations. Both income types can be present in realised gains  
      
      
      

    
**Page 764** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=764&annotation=SI6RVCHI)
      The second major innovation is that assets and liabilities should be maintained at current value. This would help ensure that holding gains and operating gains are separated on the income statement, with the authors suggesting the income statement be divided into two parts, one for each income type  
      
      
      

    
**Page 764** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=764&annotation=4A36VQR4)
      Entry price reflects the current cost of assets, while exit price reflects an opportunity cost  
      
      
      

    
**Page 764** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=764&annotation=QE33GUVQ)
      Many trace the measurement of value to an exit price to the work of Chambers. Chambers (1966) advocates an accounting system that would value the assets at the price that they could be sold for at the date of the balance sheet  
      
      
      

    
**Page 764** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=764&annotation=6XIF8HGT)
      Historically, accounting across just about all jurisdictions has been based on historical cost, an entry price measurement system with adjustments to this value encompassing depreciation, amortisation and impairment charges.2 The hyperinflationary economies of the 1970s and 1980s forced action  
      
      
      

    
**Page 765** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=765&annotation=IQHM42SV)
      nominal sales will rise proportionally with inflation. Actual taxable profits and after-tax accounting profits will increase at a rate surpassing the actual inflation rate. This occurs because inventory costs are logged at earlier, lower prices that do not reflect the current cost of replacement  
      
      
      

    
**Page 765** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=765&annotation=A56YTMVM)
      In the US, SFAS 33 issued in 1979 mandated supplementary disclosures on the effect of general inflation and income from continuing operations on a current cost basis (FASB 1979). For current cost income, expenses were measured at current cost or lower recoverable amount  
      
      
      

    
**Page 765** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=765&annotation=GRVX7GKF)
      Additionally, it was made possible to recognise the fair value of real estate assets in the financial statements, if it provided a more accurate representation of the true and fair view  
      
      
      

    
**Page 765** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=765&annotation=U2BQ34PS)
      Another economic crisis spurred standard setters to reassess measurement practices. The US savings and loans crisis in the late 1980s highlighted the limitations of historical cost accounting for financial instruments  
      
      
      

    
**Page 765** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=765&annotation=3N2QPA54)
      Under US GAAP at the time, both loans and deposits were recorded at amortised historical cost, and their fair value was not required to be disclosed. As interest rates climbed, cash flows from assets became insufficient to cover liabilities, exposing banks to significant interest risk, which was not promptly reflected in the financial statements. Consequently, many banks filed for bankruptcy before the problem was evident to investors

      (SFAS) 107, Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, in 1991 (FASB 1991). The standard mandates the disclosure of fair values for financial instruments, both assets and liabilities, for which estimating fair value is feasible. Also, it requires that entities disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in estimating fair values  
      
      
      

    
**Page 766** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=766&annotation=L4A2Q4RP)
      Trading securities are reported at fair value with unrealised gains and losses included in earnings, while available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealised gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in equity  
      
      
      

    
**Page 766** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=766&annotation=BEP7DI8E)
      Derivatives are instruments that are highly levered and their value can change very quickly. For example, a forward contract has no value at inception and therefore, will not be recorded in the financial statements prepared under historical cost accounting  
      
      
      

    
**Page 766** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=766&annotation=KUJQW7LU)
      However, these losses paled in comparison to the 1994 bankruptcy of Orange County after derivative losses of $1.7 billion, the 1998 bail out of Long-Term Capital Management for $3.6 billion and the 1995 collapse of Barings Bank, one of the oldest merchant banks in the UK. Politicians called for action  
      
      
      

    
**Page 766** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=766&annotation=3NHDNQTA)
      Disclosure of the fair value of all derivatives became mandatory with SFAS 119 (FASB 1994)  
      
      
      

    
**Page 766** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=766&annotation=T6RLUNHK)
      IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation (IASB 2003a), is primarily a disclosure standard, similar to the FASB’s SFAS 107 and SFAS 119. The disclosure provisions in IAS 32 were replaced by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, in 2005 (IASB 2005)  
      
      
      

    
**Page 766** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=766&annotation=NBGM4RES)
      IAS 39 has been amended several times, and was superseded by IFRS 9, Financial Instruments (IASB 2014), in 2018  
      
      
      

    
**Page 766** — [Open annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/UGIH6SSV?page=766&annotation=JUIFZ2KY)
      While the standards dealing with financial instruments did provide significantly more information about the firm’s exposures, both Boards failed to define what they meant by fair value. The term was loosely used to infer a market price, but there was limited discussion of what it meant in settings where active markets did not exist
