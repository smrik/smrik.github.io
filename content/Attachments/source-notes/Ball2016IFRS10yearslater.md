 <mark class="hltr-red">"efficiency of markets generally"</mark> [Page 548](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=548&annotation=IAI2IVIA)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"IFRS standards that – especially relative to US GAAP – outline broad principles rather than detailed rules"</mark> [Page 553](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=553&annotation=QY7BET5I)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"For example, IAS 16 and IAS 38 provide a choice between reporting certain long-lived assets at cost or at fair value"</mark> [Page 553](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=553&annotation=P2G72A65)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Even for shortcycle items such as financial instruments, only a minority of the IFRS adopting countries possess deep financial markets"</mark> [Page 553](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=553&annotation=P97JWVEB)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"reliability of fair values in many jurisdictions is affected by thin trading, illiquidity, wide spreads, subjective mark to model estimates and even government-administered prices"</mark> [Page 553](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=553&annotation=PC3TK6TM)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"greatest problem tend to have the weakest enforcement institutions (audit profession, legal protections, regulation, boards, analysts, press, etc.) and greatest political involvement"</mark> [Page 553](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=553&annotation=2CGEA8KD)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Fair-valuing long-cycle assets involves forecasting cash flows over substantial horizons"</mark> [Page 553](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=553&annotation=IPNB5XLE)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"The conclusion is that rules alone do not determine actual reporting practice"</mark> [Page 553](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=553&annotation=EXUK48FQ)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Many will not want to, due to domestic political and economic factors"</mark> [Page 554](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=554&annotation=PELJY2E9)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Within the EU, liquidity increases occur only in the five countries with substantial concurrent improvements in regulatory enforcement"</mark> [Page 554](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=554&annotation=7RI7VXX4)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"The experience to date with widespread IFRS adoption highlights the complexity of the regimelevel web of complementary economic, political, legal, and social institutions that affect financial reporting behavior"</mark> [Page 555](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=555&annotation=3726XLHB)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"signal needs to come at some cost to be credible"</mark> [Page 556](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=556&annotation=FMT5H83Z)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"These issues are not central in the current debate, but could become important over time."</mark> [Page 556](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=556&annotation=H5UVWEYA)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Competition among alternative economic systems, including financial reporting systems, is conducive to healthy innovation"</mark> [Page 556](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=556&annotation=UR2XFA6H)


 <mark class="hltr-purple">"most famous example in accounting being the near worldwide adoption of the Italian method of double entry bookkeeping"</mark> [Page 556](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=556&annotation=82RX96WR)

 <mark class="hltr-red">"In my view, adopting uniform worldwide standards invites risky centralization and reduced innovation."</mark> [Page 556](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=556&annotation=9RMIKM9K)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"conceptual framework, which it currently describes as follows"</mark> [Page 557](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=557&annotation=NYP3S3R4)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"One source of demand for such a framework is discomfort with a case-based approach to standard setting"</mark> [Page 557](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=557&annotation=YTEMAHPM)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"My own view is that conceptual framework is a Hayekian (1988) conceit, a delusion, and a snare. It is a conceit because the world is complex and untidy, and not organized by a small set of ideas like a conceptual framework"</mark> [Page 557](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=557&annotation=2NNN7T73)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"As well documented in Zeff (1999), the US experience with conceptual frameworks over a considerable period of time has not been very positive"</mark> [Page 557](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=557&annotation=V9C6B6XP)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Finally, a conceptual framework can prove to be a snare, because it can incent the planner that adopts and – and becomes deeply committed to it – to ignore evidence of its unintentional consequences. No planner’s framework is foolproof"</mark> [Page 557](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=557&annotation=Z6GHEP92)


 <mark class="hltr-purple">"The Law of Unintended Consequences reminds us that purposeful intervention in a complex system normally leads to unanticipated outcomes, both good and bad, however well-intentioned the intervention may be"</mark> [Page 558](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=558&annotation=K2F8A4PN)

 <mark class="hltr-red">"78% of those addressing stewardship stated it should be a separate objective of financial reporting"</mark> [Page 558](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=558&annotation=K63SPC8T)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Respondents stated that the absence of a stewardship objective would weaken shareholder rights, would give excessive emphasis to the secondary market for companies’ shares, as distinct from real decisions within firms, and would have other undesirable effects"</mark> [Page 558](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=558&annotation=V8M63JJY)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"The first-listed reason seems an attempt to finesse the valuation-stewardship divide by defining stewardship as a subset of valuation"</mark> [Page 559](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=559&annotation=DZKSUTWT)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Firms commonly contract with managers based on variables such as revenue, net income (before or after special items, discontinued operations, depreciation and amortization, interest, taxes, etc.), rate of return on assets, and rate of return on equity, for example, by paying bonuses if target levels are obtained"</mark> [Page 559](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=559&annotation=X2BRBNEY)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"The second reason given by the IASB for downgrading stewardship (that otherwise it could be confusing) underscores the notion that the world as a complex and untidy place that cannot organized by a small set of ideas in a single document like a Conceptual Framework"</mark> [Page 559](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=559&annotation=DHC2KRJ3)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Relative to the prior domestic standards of IFRS-adopting countries, the new standards provide borrowing firms with more discretion over the reported numbers that would be used in accounting-based debt covenants"</mark> [Page 560](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=560&annotation=CMCRHIQE)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"fair value accounting incorporates into firms’ earnings a larger number of shocks to firms’ asset values"</mark> [Page 560](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=560&annotation=Z9WD4U54)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"ne possible response from lenders and borrowers would be to exclude some earnings and balance sheet components from the contractual definitions of earnings and balance sheet quantities, as studied by Li (2010). However, the audited financial statements provided to lenders do not always provide sufficient information to do so"</mark> [Page 560](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=560&annotation=VGTG7I99)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Conditional conservatism refers to timelier financial-statement recognition of losses than gains. An extensive and long-standing literature holds that this asymmetry in accounting is due in large part to the use of financial statement information in debt contracting, and also to its use in firms contracting with managers"</mark> [Page 561](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=561&annotation=X8567J42)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"IASB and FASB have tried to expunge the term conservatism from their vocabulary and have only reluctantly – after receiving substantial negative feedback – recently embraced the term prudence in its stead"</mark> [Page 561](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=561&annotation=URSGCJQA)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"complete, neutral, and free from error"</mark> [Page 561](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=561&annotation=4K697GUD)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"The advocacy of using current market prices by early scholars such as Chambers (1966) set the stage for the current emphasis on fair value accounting by the IASB and the FASB"</mark> [Page 561](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=561&annotation=5HTISB6W)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"As noted in Section 2, it still is early days"</mark> [Page 562](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=562&annotation=YY6YR97Z)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"One half or more of the post-IFRS data are affected by the Global Financial Crisis"</mark> [Page 562](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=562&annotation=MIH3H8R3)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Other institutional changes occurred around the time of IFRS adoption, including changes in enforcement"</mark> [Page 562](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=562&annotation=MWC3Y8NP)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"IFRS essentially simultaneously, it is easy for the researcher to overstate the statistical significance or reliability of estimated effects"</mark> [Page 562](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=562&annotation=LJZAIT29)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"The short- and long-run effects of innovations can differ"</mark> [Page 562](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=562&annotation=83WAZKRZ)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Even if substantial in aggregate, many beneficial effects of IFRS adoption are likely to be spread across the adopting economies, and to be small and difficult or impossible to observe in individual firms"</mark> [Page 562](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=562&annotation=X8IY395M)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Ball and Brown (1968) first demonstrated the value relevance of accounting information, in the form of an association between changes in companies’ market values and changes in the earnings numbers produced by the actual financial reporting system in place at the tim"</mark> [Page 563](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=563&annotation=MQ6BJIIY)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"ate IFRS adoption is the Lee et al. (2013) report on China converging its reporting standards to IFRS in 2007. The report was commissioned by the ACCA. It purports to show that convergence increases value relevance, particularly for companies with greater legal, governance, and commercial incentives for high-quality financial reporting"</mark> [Page 563](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=563&annotation=KEF9NU54)

 <mark class="hltr-red">"For example, if all the firms in an industry adopt IFRS and all benefit from higher transparency, the effect is to reduce the industry supply price of capital"</mark> [Page 563](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=563&annotation=2D35Y8CF)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"This suggests that the expected net effect of IFRS adoption on capital costs might not be large, and would be reflected in the quantity rather than the price of new investment"</mark> [Page 564](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=564&annotation=7UJM8BCB)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"The ultimate decision lies with the SEC"</mark> [Page 565](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=565&annotation=NW8CWKTR)

 <mark class="hltr-red">"Our analysis shows that the decision to adopt IFRS mainly involves a cost-benefit trade-off between (1) recurring, albeit modest, comparability benefits for investors; (2) recurring future cost savings that will largely accrue to multinational companies; and (3) one-time transition costs borne by all firms and the U.S. economy as a whole, including those from adjustments to U.S. institutions"</mark> [Page 565](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=565&annotation=X85X4WXX)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"The SEC decision on IFRS will involve political considerations as well as economic"</mark> [Page 565](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=565&annotation=TTMABGFM)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"There are many IFRS-GAAP differences that appear to be unresolvable, despite the considerable effort the two bodies have put into the converging their standards. To date, the problem areas have been leases, financial instruments, insurance contracts, and the Conceptual Framework"</mark> [Page 566](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=566&annotation=DED9RR3A)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Under all scenarios, a US standard-setting body seems likely to continue for the indefinite future"</mark> [Page 567](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=567&annotation=E2BRWETX)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"There was good reason to expect success, based largely on widespread enthusiasm for international standards and, behind that, recognition of the strong forces of globalization"</mark> [Page 567](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=567&annotation=99KWUADC)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"For many of the claimed benefits of IFRS adoption to be realized, uniform implementation would have to occur in a wide range of countries, which seems unlikely and requires more than simply creating regulatory enforcement mechanisms"</mark> [Page 567](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=567&annotation=47Z4SX5U)


 <mark class="hltr-red">"Some evidence of actual outcomes from IFRS adoption has come to light but, by and large the evidence to date is not very useful. After a decade of hindsight, IFRS adoption is an innovation of historical proportions whose worldwide effects remain somewhat uncertain"</mark> [Page 567](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EXKELCLY?page=567&annotation=B3YUHU2N)
