## Health Disparities with Income

- **Highlights:**
	- 4.4 p.p. (67 %) higher five-year mortality for 70-year-old individuals with below-median income than those with above-median income
	- 35-year-old below-median = predicted mortality = 50-year-old above-median


> [!cite] Quote
> Approximately 60 percent of the divergence in the index across income groups is due to low-income individuals developing chronic illness at a faster rate, rather than chronically ill individuals earning lower incomes.

> [!cite] Quote
> At younger ages, differences in the prevalence of psychological disorders contribute the most to the socioeconomic gap in the index, while diabetes and cardiovascular disease become increasingly important with age.
