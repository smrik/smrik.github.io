## Keynesian beauty contest

A beauty contest, in which you are meant to select your percieved most popular pick among other judges, not the actual best contestant.

This theory stipulates that an investor could profit more by buying the stocks that are favoured by the general public, not necessarily their best percieved stock, based on fundamentals or theory.

Developed by [[John Maynard Keynes]], and developed in the Chapter 12 of his seminal work The [[General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]] (1936) to explain price fluctuations in equity markets.
