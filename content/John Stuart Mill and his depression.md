# Exploring John Stuart Mill’s Depression in an Era Without a Name for It

Recently, I was browsing the web as one does and reading the Wikipedia page about major depressive disorder specifically and stumbled upon this, which did peak my interest:

> [!quote]
> English philosopher [John Stuart Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill "John Stuart Mill") experienced a several-months-long period of what he called "a dull state of nerves", when one is "unsusceptible to enjoyment or pleasurable excitement; one of those moods when what is pleasure at other times, becomes insipid or indifferent".

> *Source: [Major depressive disorder - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder)*

Here they classify Mill as a philosopher, but I knew of him mostly as a part of my studies of economic thought. I thought it was interesting that he would describe his mood in this way, long time before depression became a medically recognized condition. So I started reading his page and found that he wrote that in his autobiography. The full text can be found here: [Autobiography, by John Stuart Mill](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/10378/10378-h/10378-h.htm) provided by the Project Gutenberg. I must admit that I did skip ahead to the 5th chapter, which focuses mostly on the topic of interest here: 

**CHAPTER V** — 1826-1832 — CRISIS IN MY MENTAL HISTORY. ONE STAGE ONWARD

At this point in his life Mill was 20 years old and is said to have been contemplating suicide. He was a very smart child, was taught Greek at the age of three, studied Latin, algebra and wrote poetry (by instruction of his father) at the age of eight. He later also read Aristotle, Adam Smith, Ricardo and such. Ricardo used to invite Mill to his house for a walk to talk about political economy. So at 20, he was already a very mature individual and started to wonder about the purpose of life.

I will quote the book a lot here, because I feel it's best to keep his words as he had written them. But this is how he described that moment of realisation: 
- .. In this frame of mind it occurred to me to put the question directly to myself: “Suppose that all your objects in life were realized; that all the changes in institutions and opinions which you are looking forward to, could be completely effected at this very instant: would this be a great joy and happiness to you?” And an irrepressible self-consciousness distinctly answered, “No!” At this my heart sank within me: the whole foundation on which my life was constructed fell down.

For me this does hit very close to home. In the past I often felt that if I would finish a task or achieve a goal, things would get better and every time after they didn't - I felt like maybe they would if I pushed a bit more and finish what I had started. But that feeling never goes away. It just lingers there forever and at one point it just feels like it will never go away and that makes it hard to try. Sounds like a terrible deal to make. "Suffer and try all your life and feel like you can almost reach the goal and you will be there any second now, but you never can. And then you die." I don't know how many people would take that deal, probably not many. A lot of what Mill wrote really spoke to me. And the feelings he described here are very similar to what I have been feeling. You can kind of make it through life, day by day, with constant sadness and no joy and only brief pauses before reality kicks back in. Talking about it doesn't really help, it's impossible to explain, all the passions seem meaningless. He doesn't explicitly state suicidal ideation but it is implied ("I did not think I could possibly bear it beyond a year.").

He describes his feelings after as:
- .. "I sought no comfort by speaking to others of what I felt"
- .. "I felt, too, that mine was not an interesting, or in any way respectable distress. There was nothing in it to attract sympathy"
- .. "During this time I was not incapable of my usual occupations. I went on with them mechanically, by the mere force of habit."
- .. "I frequently asked myself, if I could, or if I was bound to go on living, when life must be passed in this manner. I generally answered to myself that I did not think I could possibly bear it beyond a year."
- .. I felt that the flaw in my life, must be a flaw in life itself; that the question was, whether, if the reformers of society and government could succeed in their objects, and every person in the community were free and in a state of physical comfort, the pleasures of life, being no longer kept up by struggle and privation, would cease to be pleasures

Nowadays this would have clearly been classified as depression, but it is interesting how eerily similar the descriptions are and have been through time. DSM-5 states the following as diagnostic criteria of which one **bold symptom** and four other symptoms must be presented for at least 2 weeks for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode: 
- Weight loss or gain
- Change in body activity (psychomotor changes)
- Change in sleep
- **Depressed mood**
- Feelings of worthlessness and excessive or inappropriate guilt
- Indecisiveness, confusion, or a decrease in concentration
- Loss of energy
- **Loss of interest or pleasure**
- Suicidal ideation 

I think that Mill does qualify for it and thinking about it many people of the past would, but the diagnostic criteria didn't exist. I find it demoralising how some people may use statements like "nowadays anything is considered depression, back then it wasn't". Well, yes. But that doesn't mean that the disorder didn't exist, but simply that we didn't know it did, so in a way it's good that depression is much more common now. Not because it's nice that people have depression, obviously, but that more and more people are getting the help they need and that lives can be saved or greatly improved with the methods that are available to us now.

I think that this is a very good description of the loss of interest commonly caused by depression. The outlook of life changes drastically as if a dark black and white filter would be placed before your eyes and thoughts. You do not realise it, as it's a gradual process and not just a one day shift, but life just seems meaningless and things you might have enjoyed are just irrational, joyless rituals. He described his loss of interest in music like so:
- .. "The only one of the imaginative arts in which I had from childhood taken great pleasure, was music; the best effect of which (and in this it surpasses perhaps every other art) consists in exciting enthusiasm \[ ... \] The good, however, was much impaired by the thought that the pleasure of music (as is quite true of such pleasure as this was, that of mere tune) fades with familiarity, and requires either to be revived by intermittence, or fed by continual novelty \[ ... \] And it is very characteristic both of my then state, and of the general tone of my mind at this period of my life, that I was seriously tormented by the thought of the exhaustibility of musical combinations. - \[ ... \] consists only of five tones and two semitones, which can be put together in only a limited number of ways, of which but a small proportion are beautiful: most of these, it seemed to me, must have been already discovered, and there could not be room for a long succession of Mozarts and Webers, to strike out, as these had done, entirely new and surpassingly rich veins of musical beauty. This source of anxiety may, perhaps, be thought to resemble that of the philosophers of Laputa, who feared lest the sun should be burnt out.

And this also seemed like a very interesting observation of his, about the possible causes of his state of mind at the time:
- .. "I had had (as I reflected) some gratification of vanity at too early an age: I had obtained some distinction and felt myself of some importance, before the desire of distinction and of importance had grown into a passion: and little as it was which I had attained, yet having been attained too early, like all pleasures enjoyed too soon, it had made me blasé and indifferent to the pursuit"

## Improvement and search of happiness

To end on a more positive note, John Stuart Mill did find some happiness in his life after that. With time, his symptoms subsided, not fully - they often don't and people diagnosed with depression often relapse - but he got better and found meaning in life.
- .. "Relieved from my ever-present sense of irremediable wretchedness, I gradually found that the ordinary incidents of life could again give me some pleasure; that I could again find enjoyment, not intense, but sufficient for cheerfulness, in sunshine and sky, in books, in conversation, in public affairs; and that there was, once more, excitement, though of a moderate, kind, in exerting myself for my opinions, and for the public good. Thus the cloud gradually drew off, and I again enjoyed life; and though I had several relapses, some of which lasted many months, I never again was as miserable as I had been"

He found that he had previously drastically underestimated the effect of internal feeling on his mood. He used to believe in only external factors and focused on rationality almost exclusively: 
- .. "The other important change which my opinions at this time underwent, was that I, for the first time, gave its proper place, among the prime necessities of human well-being, to the internal culture of the individual. I ceased to attach almost exclusive importance to the ordering of outward circumstances, and the training of the human being for speculation and for action."

He found that the happiness of life can only appear if one does not look for it specifically:
- .. But I now thought that this end was only to be attained by not making it the direct end. Those only are happy (I thought) who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.

- .. Ask yourself whether you are happy, and you cease to be so. The only chance is to treat, not happiness, but some end external to it, as the purpose of life.

## Conclusions
I don't really know why I wrote this, probably it will just serve as a note for myself to re-read at some point later to give me some hope. That's it.
