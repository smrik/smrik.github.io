## Neoclassical Growth Model

aka Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model, or Ramsey growth model

The **Neoclassical Growth Model**, developed by **Robert Solow** and **Trevor Swan** in the 1950s, is a fundamental economic model that explains long-run economic growth through capital accumulation, labor growth, and technological progress. It builds on the **Solow-Swan model** and serves as the foundation for modern growth theory.

#### Implications:

1. **Conditional Convergence:** Poorer economies with lower capital per worker grow faster than richer ones, assuming they have similar savings rates, population growth, and access to technology.
    
2. **Role of Technology:** Since capital accumulation alone leads to diminishing returns, **long-term growth is driven by technological progress (A)**.
	
3. **Policy Insights:** Policies that encourage savings and investment can increase the steady-state level of output but do not affect long-run growth rates, which depend on exogenous technological progress.
