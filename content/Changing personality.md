## Changing personality
- Can you really change your personality?

## Summary
- Yes [[Personalities change with age|personalities change with age]]
- With some protocols the big five traits can be changed
- Neuroticism is the most malleable of the traits, followed by extroversion
- Techniques
	- Therapy - decreasing neuroticism, increasing extraversion
	- [[Mindfulness]] - decreasing neuroticism, increasing conscientiousness
	- Coaching - decreasing neuroticism, increasing extraversion, increasing openness
		- [[#Coaching protocol for extraversion]] 
	- Faking it, until making it - can increase extroversion with right instructions
		- [[#Faking it plan for extraversion]]
	- Training - meh results


## Key Points

> Yes, people really can change. And they do. Studies consistently find that there is a high degree of stability in people’s personality traits, which means that when groups of people’s traits are assessed and then reassessed some time apart, the results of the two tests are strongly correlated – but stability is not the same as immutability!
  *Note:* 

> Despite the general stability in people’s personalities, studies also consistently find that personalities change with age. A meta-analysis of 92 longitudinal studies found that the Big Five personality traits change even well past the age of 30 (contradicting the common idea that personality is ‘set in stone’ by then).
  *Note:* 

> Neuroticism appears to be the most malleable of the Big Five traits, followed by extraversion, but it is worth noting that these techniques for changing your personality are typically found to result in small or moderate changes (between 0.2 and 0.8 standard deviations, though some effects are larger).
  *Note:* 

> 1.Therapy
  *Note:* 

> Effective for: Decreasing neuroticism, increasing extraversion

It might be obvious, but it’s true: therapy has been consistently shown to reduce neuroticism (i.e., improve emotional stability), and increase extraversion. The evidence for this is extremely strong – coming from a very large number of studies, including randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses.
  *Note:* 

> 1.Mindfulness
  *Note:* 

> Effective for: Decreasing neuroticism, increasing conscientiousness

There is no universally used meaning of the word ‘mindfulness’, but scientific discussions often use some version of this famous definition: “[Mindfulness is] the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience moment by moment.” So, it’s paying careful attention (without judgment) to things you’re experiencing.
  *Note:* 

> 3. Coaching
  *Note:* 

> Effective for: Decreasing neuroticism, increasing extraversion, increasing openness

Like therapy, coaching is a very broad category. And, also like therapy, within this broad category, there are a lot of very different practices. That’s why we’re going to get into the weeds a little bit here.
  *Note:* 

> This randomized controlled trial of 54 adults aged 18-64 (M =42.18, SD = 12.44) found that a 10-week course of individual coaching from trainee psychologists can produce reductions in neuroticism and increases in extraversion that remained present after 3 months. This coaching program involved the following components:

#### Coaching protocol for extraversion

**Results:** 10-week course can produce reductions in neuroticism and increases in extraversion

**Clarify values and vision**: The client’s personality is assessed and their values are explored. Together, client and coach explore how the client’s life is going and how their personality might be affecting that. Then a vision of an “ideal self” to aim for is developed.
Choose targets for change: From that vision, the client and coach pick a few realistic personality subtraits (like self-discipline or anxiety) to focus on.

**Build a tailored plan**: Coach and client select strategies suited to those affecting those subtraits.

**For example**:
- If self-discipline (a subtrait of conscientiousness) was chosen, the client would choose from strategies like goal setting, organizational skills, life style skills, positive self-talk.
- If anxiety (a subtrait of neuroticism) was chosen, the client would choose from strategies like goal setting, positive self-talk, life style skills, cognitive therapy techniques, and exposure based techniques.

Client and coach then develop an implementation plan together.

**Practice and adjust**: Over 10 weeks, the client applies the techniques, with mid-program and end-program reassessments to track progress and refine strategies.

**Maintain gains**: Clients finish with a plan for sustaining improvements, followed by a three-month check-in to see what stuck.

  *Note:* 

> 4. Faking It (Until You Make It)
  *Note:* 

> Effective for: Decreasing neuroticism, increasing extraversion , increasing agreeableness, increasing conscientiousness
  *Note:* 

> it. Well, the studies have tended to give participants prompts like this one (for extraversion):

#### Faking it plan for extraversion

“During the next week, we would like you to try to change your behavior. Specifically, for the next 7 days, try to act as talkative, assertive, and spontaneous as you can. Previous research has shown that performing these behaviors can be beneficial. Please list five specific ideas below for how and when you will incorporate these types of behaviors into your daily life.

For example, “When my friends are discussing something important to me, I will express my opinion.”

The evidence suggests that the way you formulate your ideas for how to fake the trait matters greatly. Vague goals like “be more talkative” produced no effects, whereas goals that were either ‘small steps’ (like “Invite Jenny and Thomas for dinner”) or **conditional ‘implementation intentions’ (like IF I have an opinion on my team’s plan, THEN I will speak up and give my thoughts) were much more effective.**


> 5. Training
  *Note:* 

> Effective for: Increasing extraversion, increasing openness

There is evidence from a small number of individual studies (including randomized controlled trials and weaker studies) on specific demographics, that training programs that teach life skills might work to change personality traits. For instance:
  *Note:* 

> Some small studies (such as this one, with no inactive control group) find “initial evidence” that training in things like assertiveness and flirting can boost extraversion.
  *Note:*
